 ## Problem

Create a science explainer website that is both informative and engaging. The website should include a variety of topics, such as physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy. The design should be user-friendly and easy to navigate.

## Solution

The website will be built using a Flask application. Flask is a Python microframework that is well-suited for building simple websites. The website will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The home page of the website.
* `about.html`: A page about the website and its authors.
* `topics.html`: A page listing all of the topics covered by the website.
* `topic.html`: A page for each topic, containing a list of articles and videos.
* `article.html`: A page for each article, containing the full text of the article.
* `video.html`: A page for each video, containing the embedded video.

The website will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page.
* `/about`: The about page.
* `/topics`: The topics page.
* `/topic/<topic>`: The topic page for a specific topic.
* `/article/<article>`: The article page for a specific article.
* `/video/<video>`: The video page for a specific video.

## Design

The website will have a clean and modern design. The home page will feature a carousel of featured articles and videos. The topics page will list all of the topics covered by the website, with each topic linking to its own page. The topic pages will contain a list of articles and videos for that topic. The article and video pages will contain the full text of the article or the embedded video, respectively.

The website will be responsive, meaning that it will adapt to the size of the user's screen. The website will also be mobile-friendly, meaning that it will be easy to use on mobile devices.

## Implementation

The website will be implemented using the Flask microframework. The website will be hosted on a web server. The website will be tested using a variety of browsers and devices.

## Conclusion

The science explainer website will be a valuable resource for students and anyone else who is interested in learning about science. The website will be easy to use and navigate, and it will contain a wealth of information on a variety of topics.
